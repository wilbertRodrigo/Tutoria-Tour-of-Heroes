For the first part of the tutorial I learn the following :

-Creating new angular project. By command ng new "name of the project"
-Generating component using comman ng generate component "name of the component"

-Component is one of the building blocks of angular. Component are directives but directives with the template.
It has three important properties
selector, templateUrl, and styleUrl

-I learn how to use data binding such as event binding and property binding.
data binding is important to pass data from the view template to the corresponding component class or
from component class to the view template.

I also use pipe to alter the appearance of the heroes name using single or operator | and uppercase.
I also use interface to by declaring the type of the data.

I also learned how to loop through an array of objects using *ngFor by typing *ngFor = "let hero of heroes".
I also learned how to implement *ngIf and ngModel by installing and importing it to the app.module.ts the FormsModule.


I need to learn more how the use cases of these commands especially ngModel.

Services - I found out services play an important role in building angular projects.
First it allows unrelated components to use data or logic needed in the view template.
It prevents violating coding principles DRY (Do not Repeat Yourself) by storing the logic in the service, so the developer will not repeat the logic in the component class.
You can also use services to share data, not just the business logic.
In services, external api handles. (haven't tried yet)

Dependency injection- need more reference
Observable data -need more reference
Subscribe -need more reference
Browse RxJS - havent tried yet
interpolation binding
